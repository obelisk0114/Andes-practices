#Practice_01
Create an ant script which contains 10 ant tasks (log, echo, javac, etcâ€¦..)
The default target should be able to fork all tasks that you use
A log file should be generated after the script executed.
         
#Practice_02
Write a program that the user input an expression, the output marks out the unpaired parentheses. 
By a "paired parenthesis", it means a left parenthesis "(" matched with the nearest right parenthesis ")".
For example, (1+2), (1+2)*(2+3), and ((1+2)*3) show paired parenthesis, while (1+2)), ((1+2), and (1+2)*((2+3) do not.
In the paired cases you don't need to have output, in those unpaired cases above you should label them like this:
e.g. 
((A+B)(
^     ^
Case 1:
(1+2))
     ^
Case 2:
((1+2)
^
Case 3:
(1+2) * ((2+3)
        ^
Command line output is OK, with GUI representation is better.
